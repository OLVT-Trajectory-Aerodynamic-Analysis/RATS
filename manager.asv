% This is the command center of the project. This function is like the
% center of the spider web, everything is called from here. First the data
% is converted from the rawData format to the SDFormat. Next the manager
% determines which plotting functions to call, and does that

% @param sourceList is the list of sources in the source datatype. This
%   means that it is in the struct format
% @param config is all of the configurable parameters that might be needed
%   for the system. They are listed below
%   There are currently no config variables.
